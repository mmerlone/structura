## Key Project Characteristics

### Technology Stack

- **Next.js 15.5.6** with App Router
- **React 18.3.1** with Server Components
- **TypeScript 5.x** strict mode
- **MUI 7.3.4** with Pigment CSS
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.14**
- **Supabase** for auth and database
- **React Query 5.90.11** for state management
- **React Hook Form 7.45.4** + Zod validation
- **Pino 10.0.0** for logging
- **Sentry 10** for error tracking

### Core Principles

1. **App Router First** - All routes use Next.js 15 App Router
2. **Server Components Default** - Use Server Components unless client-side is needed
3. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript with strict mode
4. **Performance** - Optimized with MUI 7 and proper caching
5. **Security** - Comprehensive auth and input validation
6. **Developer Experience** - Excellent tooling and documentation

### Package Management

- **pnpm** is the ONLY package manager
- Never use npm or yarn
- All scripts use `pnpm run` commands

### Project Structure

```
/app                    # Next.js App Router
/src                   # Source code
  /components         # UI components
  /contexts           # React contexts
  /hooks              # Custom hooks
  /lib                # Utilities
